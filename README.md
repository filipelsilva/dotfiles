# Filipe Ligeiro Silva's Dotfiles

These are **my** dotfiles. You could use them to inspire yourself, and make your own dotfiles.
There are two sections:

## 1. Dotfiles (*per se*)

These consist of configurations for the following:
* Alacritty
* Git
* Neovim
* Starship
* Tmate
* Tmux
* Zsh

Also, there are two Zsh custom prompts.

## 2. Installers

Scripts made by me, in order to install:
* Packages (very basic, could crash due to old package names)
* Plugins
* Programs
and also to symlink the dotfiles to `/home/`.

## Usage

In order to use this repo, just run `./run.sh`.
