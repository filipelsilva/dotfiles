# Filipe Ligeiro Silva's Dotfiles

These are my dotfiles. You could use them to inspire yourself, and make your
own!

These dotfiles are intended to be used with my [NixOS
config](https://github.com/filipelsilva/nixos-config) (maybe one day I'll
merge the two repos into this one, but not anytime soon).
