# Filipe Ligeiro Silva's Dotfiles

These are my dotfiles. You could use them to inspire yourself, and make your own.
There are two sections:

## 1. Dotfiles (*per se*)

These consist of configurations for the following:
* Alacritty
* Git
* Neovim
* Starship
* Tmux/Tmate
* Zsh

Also, there are three custom Zsh prompts.

## 2. Installers

Scripts made by me, in order to install:
* Packages
* Plugins
* Programs
and also to symlink the dotfiles to `/home/`.
Keep in mind: these are **very likely to break**.
