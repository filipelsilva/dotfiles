# Filipe Ligeiro Silva's Dotfiles

These are my dotfiles. You could use them to inspire yourself, and make your own.
There are two sections:

## 1. Dotfiles (*per se*)

These consist of configurations for the following:
* Alacritty
* (Neo)Vim
* Tmux
* Zsh
* Git

## 2. Installers

Scripts made by me, in order to link the dotfiles to their places and install all needed packages.
Keep in mind: these are **very likely to break**.
